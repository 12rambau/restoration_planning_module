## Mapping Tool for Forest Restoration Suitability and Impact: Improving strategic decision making in forest restoration

Restoration of forests and other key ecosystems is a major nature-based solution towards meeting a wide range of global development goals and national priorities, including Sustainable Development Goals, but the stakes are high and financial resources are limited. Country governments, international organizations, and other restoration stakeholders need to identify and prioritize locations suitable for restoration. To be truly effective and best approximate realistic restoration potential requires information on not only ecological conditions for tree growth but also restoration’s socioeconomic impacts, including benefits, costs, and risks. Locations where benefits are high relative to costs and risks are where restoration is more likely to achieve sustainable success. These locations are also where initiatives are more likely to attract the private investment needed to augment government funding and official development assistance.  
This mapping tool combines ecological data on forest restoration with data on its benefits, costs, and risks. The tool is intended to support the preparation of strategic restoration plans for a given region—a country, group of countries, or region within a country—by providing improved, spatially explicit information on restoration suitability and impacts. The results are intended to aid decision makers in identifying promising, cost-effective restoration locations, and with identifying tradeoffs among impacts that might require further attention.   
This tool facilitates the creation of maps and related information most relevant to the user’s restoration region and objectives, through a user-friendly dashboard. For example, maps might show where potential carbon storage increases (or livelihood benefits, etc.) are greatest relative to restoration costs and risks. Users have the choice of using default weights for the different data layers or specifying their own weights, and they can impose constraints that are relevant for their region and objectives (e.g., restrict restoration to locations where forests naturally occur).

This tool has been developed by FAO in close collaboration with Spatial Informatics Group (SIG), SilvaCarbon and researchers at Peking University and Duke University, with financial support from the Government of Japan.
