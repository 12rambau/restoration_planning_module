benefits,Wood production,Woodfuel harvest,users/bornToBeAlive/random300,"Wood fuel harvest in the SEPAL FR planning tool refers to the existing annual harvest of wood fuel per hectare of forest. A higher level of wood fuel harvest implies greater demand for wood fuel as an energy source, which tends to make FR more feasible when supply of wood to meet local demands is a desired benefit. <br> Harvest is expressed in cubic meters per hectare for 2015. It varies by country and, for countries with sufficient data, by first-level administrative subdivision (e.g., state or province). The harvest reported by the tool is the average for a country or subdivision. The actual harvest at different locations within a country or subdivision could be higher or lower than the reported average estimate.",Ha

A higher growth rate tends to make forest restoration more feasible when desired benefits include income for landholders and wood supply to meet local demands.\nThe growth rate is expressed in dry tons per hectare per year. The resolution of the dataset is approximately 55km. The rate reported by the tool is the average for a grid cell.

Greater accessibility can make FR more feasible by increasing the return earned by forest products sold in urban markets, but it can also make FR less feasible by increasing the return earned by products from nonforest land uses.

A higher level of forest employment implies attractive business conditions for labor-intensive wood harvesting and processing industries, which tends to make forest restoration more feasible when income for local households is a desired benefit. \nForest employment is the sum of jobs across three economic activities in 2015: forestry, logging, and related service activities; manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; and manufacture of paper and paper products. It varies by country and, for countries with sufficient data, by first-level administrative subdivision (e.g., state or province).

costs,monetary,Establishment cost,projects/john-ee-282116/assets/fao-restoration/features/AfCost_ha,"Establishment cost in the SEPAL FR planning tool refers to expenses associated with active forest restoration on former agricultural land: preparing a site for tree regeneration, and then artificially regenerating the site by sowing seeds or planting seedlings. A higher establishment cost tends to make FR less feasible, although FR can be feasible on land with a high establishment cost if land opportunity cost is low and FR generates large benefits.\nEstablishment cost is expressed in US dollars per hectare. It varies by country and, for countries
with sufficient data, by first-level administrative subdivision (e.g., state or province). The cost
reported by the tool is the average for the country or subdivision. The actual cost at different
locations within the country or subdivision could be higher or lower than the reported average
estimate. In addition, compared to the estimates reported by the tool, the SEPAL FR planning
tool team estimates that establishment cost is, on average, 45% higher if the restoration site is a
forest that has been heavily damaged (for example, by fire, windthrow, or pest outbreak) and
66% lower if passive restoration, which relies on natural tree regeneration, is feasible. The tool
contains a variable that predicts the likely success of natural regeneration.",Ha
